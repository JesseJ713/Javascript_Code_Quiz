## Project Status

I've built the homepage which includes buttons for the user to either start the quiz or view local high scores. The idea is to have the different pages exist as HTML, but only display once the user interacts with the appropriate parts of the page. Setting a background color for flair. Much room for improvement.

Functionality is all over the place. Going to have that as my main focus since I believe the template is set for fine-tuning. Getting the separate pieces to interact with each other have been the hardest part. Thankfully, with this practice I have grown a little more comfortable with the DOM.

Had a quick tutoring session where they pointed out my button functionality. I've now set the answers to be globally listened by clicks and they seem to be functioning properly now!

Struggling with displaying high scores and having the values stored in the local storage properly. This will be my main focus going forward.

Finally able to reach into local storage and display information regarding users and their high scores, but having troubles displaying them in a stylish manner. I believe it has to do with the appending children structure. I will reach out for help on this manner. Happy to make a little bit of progress on my own though!

Reached out to tutor who was also stumped as to why styling wasn't displaying properly for high score. Will have to review this piece of code once I'm more knowledgeable of the subject.
