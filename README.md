## Project Status

I've built the homepage which includes buttons for the user to either start the quiz or view local high scores. The idea is to have the different pages exist as HTML, but only display once the user interacts with the appropriate parts of the page. Setting a background color for flair. Much room for improvement.

Functionality is all over the place. Going to have that as my main focus since I believe the template is set for fine-tuning. Getting the separate pieces to interact with each other have been the hardest part. Thankfully, with this practice I have grown a little more comfortable with the DOM.

Had a quick tutoring session where they pointed out my button functionality. I've now set the answers to be globally listened by clicks and they seem to be functioning properly now!
